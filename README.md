# Moov-Now-swimming-data-export
The Moov Now  device will track your ride, run, swim, cycle, box, HIIT and crossfit accurately, but it does not have any export option or backup options. This is a modified version of the official Moov Now Coach application wich allows you to export swimming timings to the "MoovBackup" folder as csv files. You have to open and close the swimming in history, and the swimming will be saved. It works on any Android 4.4 device or more than 4.4 or on an Android PC emulator, such as Nox. 
Install and enjoy.

Update:

  I built a new Moov Now Coach MOD to export swim sessions to FIT and csv files.
  Just open your swim session from history and find into MoovBackup folder the exported files.
  Use FIT files to upload your workout to Strava.com and Swim.com or analyse on SwimmingWatchTools.com
  Use csv files to analyse on computer with spreadsheet app.
  Every swimming stroke timing is included in csv file.
